# Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string' in TypeScript
This example demonstrates a common TypeScript error: Argument of type 'string[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.  The `greeter` function expects a single string, but an array of strings is passed. This is a type error caught by TypeScript's type system.
